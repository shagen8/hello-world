# hello-world
My first repository
Hello world! My name is Shaun and I've always wanted to learn to code so here I am giving it an actual go. This is my first foray and I'm following the GitHub guide. My first project is to build the 'Digsy Cup' aka the fickle friend tracker aka the unofficial champion tracker. 
I like tacos and think I might go and get some tonight for Taco Thursday (Australia is a little upside down).
